# Java Data Access (JDBC)

## Software Design

## Database breeds

**Networked DBMS**

The most of DBMS make use of the **TCP protocol** for communicating with applications. They accept incoming connections on a specific **TCP port**.
This allows both **local and remote connections**.
- MS SQL Server (TCP:1433)
- PostGreSQL (TCP:5432)
- MySQL (TCP:3306)
- Oracle (TCP:1521)

**Local Database**

A family of libraries **capable of simulating a DBMS connection while providing access to a local file (or memory) using SQL**.

- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
- [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html)
- [HSQLDB](https://hsqldb.org/)
- [Apache Derby](https://db.apache.org/derby/)


## The JDBC API

*“An **API** that lets you access virtually **any tabular data source** from the Java programming language"*
- What’s an API? *Application Programming Interface*
- What’s a tabular data source? **Relational databases, spreadsheets, CSV
files.**

We’ll focus on accessing relational databases. Nevertheless, the same principles can be applied to all data sources.

## Vendor specific drivers
JDBC drivers **provide the connection to the database** and **implement the protocol for transferring queries and results** between the client and the database. JDBC is an abstract API mostly composed of interfaces and abstract classes. Concrete implementations are provided within specific drivers:

- [PostGreSQL] <https://jdbc.postgresql.org/>
- [MySQL] <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/>
- [SQLite] <https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc>

**Drivers are Java binary classes (.class files) usually packaged in a single .jar archive and have to be included in the CLASSPATH**. For including vendor specific drivers (or any external library) into the project, two main ways exist:
* Manually download a .jar file and add it to the CLASSPATH of the project (not a good idea!)
* Configure a building tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) to download it and make it available to the project

An example of Maven configuration is reported below. The *dependencies* section actually refers to external libraries to be included within the project.

## Establish Connections

### Driver Manager
The basic service for managing a set of JDBC drivers. When the method _getConnection_ is called, the _DriverManager_ will attempt to locate a suitable driver from amongst those loaded at initialization and those loaded explicitly using the same classloader as the current applet or application.

* DriverManager.getConnection(String url);
* DriverManager.getConnection(String url, String user, String password);
* DriverManager.getConnection(String url, Properties prop);

```
/* PostgreSQL */
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/jdbc_schema?user=user&password=secret&ssl=false");

/* MySQL*/
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:mysql://localhost/dbname?user=user&password=pass"); 

/* SQLite */
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:sqlite:filename.db");
```

### Connection pooling
Connection pooling is a well-known data access pattern. Its main purpose is to reduce the overhead involved in performing database connections and read/write database operations. At the most basic level, a connection pool is a database connection cache implementation that can be configured to suit specific requirements.

The sequence of steps involved in a typical database connection life cycle:
* Opening a connection to the database using the database driver
* Opening a TCP socket for reading/writing data
* Reading / writing data over the socket
* Closing the connection
* Closing the socket

It becomes evident that database connections are fairly expensive operations, and as such, should be reduced to a minimum in every possible use case (in edge cases, just avoided). Here’s where connection pooling implementations come into play. By just simply implementing a database connection container, which allows us to reuse a number of existing connections, we can effectively save the cost of performing a huge number of expensive database trips. This boosts the overall performance of our database-driven applications.

```
public class App {
    private final static Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(App.class);
    HikariDataSource dataSource;
    
    ...

    private void dbConnection() {
        LOG.info("** dbConnection() **");
        HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
        config.setDriverClassName("org.postgresql.Driver");
        config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/jdbc_schema?user=user&password=secret&ssl=false");
        config.setLeakDetectionThreshold(2000);
        dataSource = new HikariDataSource(config);
    }
    
    ...

    private void testSelect() {
        LOG.info("** testSelect() **");
        try (
            Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection(); 
            PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM book LIMIT 100"); 
            ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery()) {
                while (rs.next()) {
                    LOG.info(rowToString(rs));
                }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException();
        }
    }
}
```

## Create and Execute Statements

The JDBC _Statement_, _CallableStatement_, and _PreparedStatement_ interfaces define the methods and properties enabling developers to **send SQL and eventually receive data** from your database. Once you've created a _Statement_ object, you can use it to interact with the database in two main ways:

_int executeUpdate (String SQL)_: Used for **writing** the database. Use this method to execute SQL statements such as **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE, etc.** Returns the **number of rows** affected by the execution of the SQL statement.

```
private void testUpdate() {
    LOG.info("** testUpdate() **");
    try (
        Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection(); 
        PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement("UPDATE book SET pages=? WHERE id=?")) {
            ps.setInt(1, 333);
            ps.setInt(2, 1);
            ps.executeUpdate();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException();
    }
}
```


2. _ResultSet executeQuery (String SQL)_: Used for **reading** the database. Use this method to execute SQL statements such as **SELECT**. Returns a _ResultSet_ object.

```
private void testSelect() {
    LOG.info("** testSelect() **");
    try (
        Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection(); 
        PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM book LIMIT 100"); 
        ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery()) {
            while (rs.next()) {
                LOG.info(rowToString(rs));
            }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException();
    }
}
```



### Issues with Locales

Locales (among other things) influence the way in which strings are formatted. They can have nasty consequences when creating SQL statements using string formatting (String.format()).

```
String sql = String.format(
    "INSERT INTO person (name, surname, salary) VALUES ('%s', '%s', '%f')",  
    person.getName(),
    person.getSurname(),
    person.getSalary()
);

statement.executeUpdate(sql);
```

The _sql_ variable can either contain:

* "INSERT INTO person (name, surname, salary) VALUES ('Mario', 'Rossi', '11.2')"
or
* "INSERT INTO person (name, surname, salary) VALUES ('Mario', 'Rossi', '11,2')"

Depending on the Locale used. For example:

* Locale locale = new Locale("en", "US");
or
* Locale locale = new Locale("it", "IT");


## Receive ResultSets
The _java.sql.ResultSet_ interface represents the **result set of a database query**. Objects implementing the _ResultSet_ interface maintain a **cursor pointing to the current row** of the result set and offer a useful group of methods for navigating and getting those results.

### Navigational methods

```
boolean absolute(int row) throws SQLException
```
Moves the cursor to the given row number in this ResultSet object.

```
void afterLast() throws SQLException
```

Moves the cursor to the end of this ResultSet object, just after the last row. This method has no effect if the result set contains no rows.

```
void beforeFirst() throws SQLException
```
Moves the cursor to the front of this ResultSet object, just before the first row. This method has no effect if the result set contains no rows.

```
boolean first() throws SQLException
```

Moves the cursor to the first row in this ResultSet object.

```
boolean last() throws SQLException
```

Moves the cursor to the last row in this ResultSet object.


```
boolean next() throws SQLException
```

Moves the cursor forward one row from its current position. A ResultSet cursor is initially positioned before the first row; the first call to the method next makes the first row the current row; the second call makes the second row the current row, and so on.

```
boolean previous() throws SQLException
```
Moves the cursor to the previous row in this ResultSet object. When a call to the previous method returns false, the cursor is positioned before the first row. Any invocation of a ResultSet method which requires a current row will result in a SQLException being thrown.

```
boolean relative(int rows) throws SQLException
```

Moves the cursor a relative number of rows, either positive or negative.


### Getter methods 

This group of methods is used to get the data in the columns of the current row being pointed by the cursor. They all have the following form:

resultSet.get**type**(**id**)

where:
* **type** is the primitive data type of the request column.
* **id** can be the String **name** of the column or its numerical **id**.

For example:

```
Long id = resultSet.getLong("id")
String lastName = resultSet.getString("lastName")
Integer age = resultSet.getInt("age")
Double salary = resultSet.getDouble("salary")
```

or

```
Long id = resultSet.getLong(1)
String lastName = resultSet.getString(2)
Integer age = resultSet.getInt(3)
Double salary = resultSet.getDouble(4)
```

As a general rule, names are preferred over id because they make the code more readable.

## Operational Aspects

### Dealing with errors
Programs should recover from errors and **always** leave the database in a consistent state. **Runtime errors must be minimized in industrial applications!** 

The _try-with-resources_ statement is a try statement that declares one or more resources. A resource is an object that must be closed after the program is finished with it. The _try-with-resources_ statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement. Any object that implements _java.lang.AutoCloseable_, which includes all objects which implement _java.io.Closeable_, can be used as a resource.

```
private void testSelect() {
    LOG.info("** testSelect() **");
    try (
        Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection(); 
        PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM book LIMIT 100"); 
        ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery()) {
            while (rs.next()) {
                LOG.info(rowToString(rs));
            }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException();
    }
}
```

### Mapping JDBC and Java types
There are significant variations between the SQL types supported by different database products. For example, most of the major databases support an SQL data type for large binary values, but Oracle calls this type LONG RAW, Sybase calls it IMAGE and Informix calls it BYTE.

JDBC programmers mostly program with existing database tables, and they need not concern themselves with the exact SQL type names that were used. The one major place where programmers may **need to use SQL type names** is in the SQL CREATE TABLE statement when they are **creating a new database table**. In this case programmers must take care to use SQL type names that are supported by their target database.

| Java Type                  | SQL Type               |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| `boolean`                  | `BOOLEAN` or `BIT`     |
| `byte`                     | `TINYINT`              |
| `short`                    | `SMALLINT`             |
| `int`                      | `INT`                  |
| `long`                     | `BIGINT`               |
| `float`                    | `REAL`                 |
| `double`                   | `DOUBLE`               |
| `java.math.BigDecimal`     | `DECIMAL` or `NUMERIC` |
| `java.sql.Date`            | `DATE`                 |
| `java.sql.Time`            | `TIME`                 |
| `java.sql.Timestamp`       | `TIMESTAMP`            |
| `String`                   | `VARCHAR` or `CHAR`    |
| `byte[]`                   | `VARBINARY` or `BLOB`  |
| `java.sql.Array`           | `ARRAY`                |
| `java.sql.ResultSet`       | `CURSOR`               |
| `java.sql.Struct`          | `STRUCT`               |
| `java.sql.Clob`            | `CLOB`                 |
| `java.sql.Blob`            | `BLOB`                 |
| `java.sql.Ref`             | `REF`                  |
| `java.sql.SQLXML`          | `SQLXML`               |
| `java.util.UUID`           | `UUID`                 |

Note: This table provides a general mapping, and there may be variations depending on the specific SQL database you are using. 



### Advanced Result Set
ResultSet are iterator-like objects. With default ResultSets:
* It is **not possible to move back and forth**. Only **next()** can be called. 
* It is **not possible to modify the underlying the database**. Data have to be manipulated in memory and stored back with another operation (_Statement.executeUpdate()_).



```
Statement createStatement(int resultSetType,
                          int resultSetConcurrency)
                   throws SQLException
```

However, the above method call creates *Statement* objects with additional capabilities:

* resultSetType - a result set type; one of _ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE_
* resultSetConcurrency - a concurrency type; one of _ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE_

#### Scrollable ResultSet

```
Statement statement = connection.createStatement( 
    ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE, 
    ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);

ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(“SELECT * FROM person");

resultSet.previous();     // go 1 record back
resultSet.relative(-5);   // go 5 records back
resultSet.relative(7);    // go 7 records forward
resultSet.absolute(100);  // go to 100th record
```

#### Updateable ResultSet

```
Statement statement = connection.createStatement( 
    ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE, 
    ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);
    
ResultSet resultSet = s.executeQuery(“SELECT * FROM students WHERE type="car_lover");

while (resultSet.next()) {
    int grade = rs.getInt("grade");
    resultSet.updateInt("grade", grade + 1);
    resultSet.updateRow();
}
```

### MetaData

#### Connection MetaData
_Connection_ objects provide _DatabaseMetaData_ objects which provide general information describing:
* tables
* supported SQL grammar
* supported capabilities of the connection
* stored procedures *(A group of SQL statements forming a logical unit aimed at performing a specific task)*

```
// Get metadata
DatabaseMetaData md = connection.getMetaData();   

// Verify ResultSet supported types
System.out.println("-- ResultSet Type --");
System.out.println("Supports TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY: " + md.supportsResultSetType(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY));
System.out.println("Supports TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE: " + md.supportsResultSetType(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE));
System.out.println("Supports TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE: " + md.supportsResultSetType(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE));
```

#### ResultSet MetaData
_ResultSet_ objects provides _ResultSetMetaData_ objects which provide schema information. Useful for writing code running on different tables. For example, converting in JSON or XML the output of different queries.

```
public static void printAnyResultSet(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    ResultSetMetaData md = rs.getMetaData();
    
    // get number of columns
    int nCols = md.getColumnCount();
 
    // print column names
    for (int i = 1; i < nCols; i++) {
        System.out.print(md.getColumnName(i) + ",");
    }
}
```

### Transactions

A transaction is a **set of actions to be performed atomically**. **Either all the actions are carried out, or none of them are.**

The classic example of when transactions are necessary is movement between bank accounts. You need to transfer $100 from one account to the other. You do so by subtracting $100 from the first account and adding $100 to the second account. If this process fails after you have subtracted the $100 from the first bank account, the $100 is never added to the second bank account. The money is lost in cyberspace.

- JDBC allows SQL statements to be grouped together into a single transaction
- Transaction control is performed by the Connection object, default mode is _auto-commit_, i.e., each sql statement is treated as a transaction
- We can turn off the auto-commit mode with _connection.setAutoCommit(false)_;
- And turn it back on with _connection.setAutoCommit(true)_;
- Once auto-commit is off, no SQL statement will be committed until an explicit is invoked _connection.commit()_. At this point all changes done by the SQL statements will be made permanent in the database.

```
private void testUpdate() {
    try (
        Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection(); 
        PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement("UPDATE book SET pages=? WHERE id=?")
        ) {
            // disable auto-commit
            connection.setAutoCommit(false);
        
            // the first book has 100 pages
            ps.setInt(1, 100);
            ps.setInt(2, 1);
            ps.executeUpdate();
            
            // the second book has 200 pages
            ps.setInt(1, 200);
            ps.setInt(2, 2);
            ps.executeUpdate();
            
            // all changes are actually committed together
            connection.commit();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException();
    }
}
```

## Software Engineering

### Repository
Repository layer is added between the domain and data mapping layers to isolate domain objects from
details of the database access code and to minimize scattering and duplication of query code. The
Repository pattern is especially useful in systems where number of domain classes is large or heavy
querying is utilized.

Let's say we need a persistent data store for persons. Adding new persons and searching for them
according to different criteria must be easy. Repository architectural pattern creates a uniform layer of data repositories that can be used for CRUD operations.

```
public interface Repository<T, ID> {
    Optional<T> findById(ID id);
    Iterable<T> findAll();
    T save(T entity);
    void delete(T entity);
    void deleteById(ID id);
    void deleteAll();
}
```

```
public class PlaneRepository implements Repository<Plane, Long> {
    private final HikariDataSource dataSource;

    public PlaneRepository(HikariDataSource dataSource) {
        this.dataSource = dataSource;
        checkTable();
    }

    private void checkTable() {
        String sql = "SELECT * FROM planes LIMIT 1";
        try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection();
             PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {
            ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // Must be disabled in production!
            initTable();
        }
    }

    private void initTable() {
        String sql = "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS planes;" +
                "CREATE TABLE planes " +
                "(id SERIAL, " +
                "name VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL, " +
                "length DOUBLE PRECISION DEFAULT NULL, " +
                "wingspan DOUBLE PRECISION DEFAULT NULL, " +
                "firstFlight DATE DEFAULT NULL, " +
                "category VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL, " +
                "PRIMARY KEY (id))";
        try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection();
            PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {
            statement.executeUpdate();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    @Override
    public Optional<Plane> findById(Long Id) {
        String sql = "SELECT * FROM planes WHERE id=?";
        try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection();
             PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {
            statement.setLong(1, Id);
            ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery();

            if (!rs.next()) {
                return Optional.empty();
            }
